I'm just experimenting with how to visualise the geodesics in spacetime under general relativity. Please help with suggestions!

Live demo: https://timhutton.github.io/GravityIsNotAForce/

History: (please help fill in the gaps!)
- 2014: A [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTVIMOix3I) showed a 'spacetime stretcher' whereby objects in free-fall move along straight lines.
- 2019: A [PDF here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ab08f5/pdf) references that youtube video and commends the approach to educators.
- Other youtube videos have used similar diagrams. [add links]

TO-DO list:
- Is the 1+1 approach used (a constant gravitational field) in any way sensible or rigourous?
- Can we extend to 1+1 with a point mass on the 1D space line?
- Can we extend to 2+1 in any useful way? Perhaps by considering a single geodesic (e.g. an elliptic orbit) as a straight line and drawing the rest of the universe as a (possibly very strange) distorted grid around that geodesic?
